A game of falling tetrominoes written entirely in pure x86 assembly, for pure Linux (libc etc. not needed).

To build, just run:

	nasm -f bin wrapper.asm -o a.out
	chmod +x a.out

shapes.asm is auto-generated using gen_shapes.lua; if you need to regenerate it, run (using Lua 5.3 or newer):

	lua gen_shapes.lua > shapes.asm
